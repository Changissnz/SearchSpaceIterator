*About*

An iterator, that can be run in sequential
mode, for k-dim search spaces. A search space in this
program is defined as an `n x 2` matrix that represents a continuous
space. Column 0 of row `i` denotes the minimum value and column 1 denotes the maximum value of row `i`.

Program can certainly be extended for mathematical purposes.
